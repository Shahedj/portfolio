I then created an IAM user with read-only permissions. I installed a Python virtual environment and set up Scout Suite, a security auditing tool that assess cloud environment security measures, to perform a posture scan of the AWS environment. This scan identified potential security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities like disabled password expiration policies, Wrote a report with evidence and mitigation steps. I then corrected 3 of the security misconfigurations such as implementing a password eXpiration policy, MFA, and the allowed amount of tries of entering the correct password to 3 times only to prevent brute force attacks."

I analyzed network traffic using Wireshark to identify the source IP address of a malicious email using packet sniffing of a .pcap file. I then used the IP address to match it to a host device using DHCP logs and confirmed the logged-in user via security logs by looking at the events and activites logged. This process revealed that the suspicious emails originated from host USER2, which was accessed by user John Doe at the time of the incident, identifying the rogue actor."
